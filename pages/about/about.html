            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in <strong>2024</strong>, <strong>Sancturia Wildlife</strong> emerged from a deep-rooted passion for wildlife conservation and a recognition of the challenges faced by sanctuaries in India. Many sanctuaries operate with limited resources, relying on donations to provide care, rehabilitation, and sanctuary for injured, orphaned, and rescued animals.
